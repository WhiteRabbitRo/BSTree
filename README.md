# BSTree
C++ Project "Binary Search Tree"

# General information
Your attention is represented by the implementation of a binary search tree in the programming language C++. The following functions are implemented in this assembly (a.k.a class methods) for working with BSTree: 
- displaying the tree on the screen
- displaying the list of tree nodes (3 ways)
- adding a node to the tree
- removing the node from the tree 
- saving the tree to the file
- loading the tree from the file
- checking for a node
Also implemented are methods such as an initialization list and two statements: output to the stream and an assignment operator.
# How to compile the program
You can compile the program through the command line of the terminal:

$ g++ main.cpp [-std=c++14]

Or with the help of built-in IDE-environment compilers.

# How to run the program
The format of running the program through the command line is as follows:

$ ./bstree <item1> <item2> <item3> ...
